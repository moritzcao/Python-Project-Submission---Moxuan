IMDB is the world's most authoritative source for movie. To get movie information, I used advanced search in IMDB and got a list of top 1000 popular movies.

I used Selenium to scrape moviesâ€™ ranking, title, year, genre and description from IMDB.

The results were stored in a txt file. Columns were separated by \t to make Pandas easier to read as CSV.


I created a function to use Pandas to read result file as DataFrame. The function is also able to output a movie info dictionary based on a user-input genre. 


I also created an app using Tkinter package. User could select a genre he interested in and click OK button.


Then, the app displays a random movie that matches the desired input genre.
